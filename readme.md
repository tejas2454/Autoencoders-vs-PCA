# ﻿Autoencoders Vs. PCA
## Problem Statement Implement a simple encoder-decoder neural network with one hidden layer using theimages of George Bush from the LFW Face database.  Use the MSE loss and 70:20:10train:val:test split to train the network. Compare the reconstruction error with a simple(linear)PCA (use the same split.  Vary the number of the top few eigen vectors duringreconstruction)
